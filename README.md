Cristina Cuisine
=================================

Cristina Cuisine is a web application that suggests Thai dishes and uses
the expert system to speed up the process. The designed website operates
on the premise of what ingredients the user wants to use, and asks the user
for different inputs. The system uses this information to inquire recipes
and suggest them to the users. Presenting the appropriate dishes within
the calories range is the main goal for the early stages of the application.
